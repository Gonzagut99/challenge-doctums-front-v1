# Known Bugs and Issues

This document outlines known bugs and issues in the application, based on the audit documentation.

## Critical Issues

1. **Game Creation Error**
   - **Issue**: Error when creating a new game session
   - **Location**: [app/routes/game+/_layout.tsx](mdc:app/routes/game+/_layout.tsx)
   - **Cause**: Improper management of useState hooks
   - **Details**: Documented in [auditorias/b_1.md](mdc:auditorias/b_1.md)

2. **WebSocket Connection Failures**
   - **Symptoms**: Game state not updating, errors in console
   - **Location**: [app/services/ws/index.ts](mdc:app/services/ws/index.ts)
   - **Potential Fix**: Implement better error handling and reconnection logic

3. **Navigation Issues**
   - **Symptoms**: Modals not showing correctly, incorrect routing
   - **Location**: [app/routes/game+/_layout.tsx](mdc:app/routes/game+/_layout.tsx)
   - **Cause**: State variables like `legacyModal_hasNavigated` and `submitPlan_hasNavigated` not properly managed

## Implementation Recommendations

- Add proper error boundaries for handling WebSocket failures
- Implement fallback mechanisms for critical state management
- Ensure proper conditions for navigation in useEffect hooks
- Validate session and player IDs before making WebSocket calls
