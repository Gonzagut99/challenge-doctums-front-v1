# UseStates Hook Implementations

## Critical Implementations

1. **File:** `app/routes/game+/_layout.tsx`
   - **Hook:** `useState`
   - **Description:** This hook manages various game states such as `avatarId`, `legacyModal_hasNavigated`, and `submitPlan_hasNavigated`. These states are critical as they control the navigation and display of modals, which are essential for user interaction and game progression.

2. **File:** `app/routes/game+/_gameCanvas/index.tsx`
   - **Hook:** `useState`
   - **Description:** The `grabbing` state is critical as it affects the user interaction with the game canvas, determining whether the user can interact with the game elements.

3. **File:** `app/components/custom/music/SoundContext.tsx`
   - **Hook:** `useState`
   - **Description:** The states `isMusicPlaying` and `isSoundOn` are critical for managing the audio experience of the application, directly impacting user experience.

## Weak Points

### Critical Implementations

1. **File:** `app/routes/game+/_layout.tsx`
   - **Potential Break Points:**
     - Incorrect state initialization or updates could lead to navigation issues or incorrect modal displays.
     - If `useLiveLoader` fails to fetch data, it might cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly.

2. **File:** `app/routes/game+/_gameCanvas/index.tsx`
   - **Potential Break Points:**
     - The `grabbing` state might not update correctly if the `useEffect` dependencies are not managed properly, leading to interaction issues.
     - If the `localDivRef` is not correctly assigned, it could prevent the game canvas from functioning as expected.

3. **File:** `app/components/custom/music/SoundContext.tsx`
   - **Potential Break Points:**
     - Audio playback might fail if the `audioRef` is not correctly initialized or if the audio file is missing.
     - Toggling music or sound states might not work if the context is not properly provided to components.

## Non-Critical Implementations

1. **File:** `app/app.client.tsx`
   - **Hook:** `useState`
   - **Description:** The `canMoveSprite` and `spritePosition` states are used for sprite movement in the MainMenu scene. While important for gameplay, they are not critical as they do not affect the core functionality of the application.

2. **File:** `app/components/custom/landing/Header.tsx`
   - **Hook:** `useState`
   - **Description:** The `isMobileMenuOpen` and `isOpen` states manage the visibility of the mobile menu and header. These are not critical as they do not impact the main functionality of the application.

3. **File:** `app/routes/home+/index.tsx`
   - **Hook:** `useState`
   - **Description:** The `showStaticImage` state is used for displaying a static image after a delay. This is not critical as it is primarily for visual effect and does not affect application logic.

## Code Implementations

### Critical Implementations

1. **File:** `app/routes/game+/_layout.tsx`
   ```tsx
   const [avatarId, setAvatarId] = useState<string | null>(
       localPlayer?.avatar_id || null
   );
   const [legacyModal_hasNavigated, legacyModal_setHasNavigated] = useState(false);
   const [submitPlan_hasNavigated, submitPlan_setHasNavigated] = useState(false);
   useEffect(() => {
       if (showLegacyModal && !legacyModal_hasNavigated) {
           legacyModal_setHasNavigated(true);
           navigate(`/game/legacyRewards?sessionCode=${sessionCode}&playerId=${playerId}`);
       }
   }, [showLegacyModal, legacyModal_hasNavigated, navigate]);
   ```

2. **File:** `app/routes/game+/_gameCanvas/index.tsx`
   ```tsx
   const [grabbing, setGrabbing] = useState(false);
   return (
       <div
           {...rest}
           ref={localDivRef}
           id="GameCanvas"
           className={twMerge("w-[800px] h-[442px] cursor-grab",className,  grabbing && "cursor-grabbing")}
           role="button"
           tabIndex={0}
           onMouseDown={() => setGrabbing(true)}
           onMouseUp={() => setGrabbing(false)}
       ></div>
   );
   ```

3. **File:** `app/components/custom/music/SoundContext.tsx`
   ```tsx
   const [isMusicPlaying, setIsMusicPlaying] = useState(true);
   const [isSoundOn, setIsSoundOn] = useState(true);
   const toggleMusic = () => setIsMusicPlaying((prev) => !prev);
   const toggleSound = () => {
       setIsSoundOn((prev) => {
           console.log("isSoundOn cambia a:", !prev);
           return !prev;
       });
   };
   ```
